<h1>Mobile App Consept Presentation</h1>
<p>
    This mini-project is a Web-Poster designed to showcase an early version of an Android app called &apos;Smishing Buster&apos;.
    The app was developed in an academic setting as part of a CS degree, with the purpose of helping users protect themselves from SMS phishingâ€”also known as &apos;Smishing&apos;.
</p>
<p>
    The Web-Poster presents the concept, mechanics, and a video demo of the app in a clean and minimalist format.
